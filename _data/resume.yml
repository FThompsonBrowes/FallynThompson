  summary: >
    As a data scientist and data visualization specialist, I have 9+ years experience managing global projects 
   that distill complex data into clear, accessible findings successfully implemented across multi-disciplinary teams. 
   I enjoy tackling pain points that require scoping projects from conception, collaborating across departments, 
   and ensuring data literacy support. Part of my function is to bridge technology language and semantic gaps 
   to ensure projects have clear communication and a shared consensus of expectations and deliverables. 
    My expertise is sorting through a mess of raw data to pull out actionable insights and achieve real-time analytics 
    that drive decision-making. My past projects have focused on working with dirty data and building infographics and dashboards 
   for a range of stakeholders from the Government of Canada Department of Foreign Affairs, UNICEF, Fortune 500s, and nonprofits. 
   Specialties/ SQL, Python (timeseries, market basket measures analysis, Plotly), Tableau Infographics and Dashboards
   Areas of Interest/ Anomaly detection, Behavioural economics, Cross-cultural studies, Global healthcare, Womenâ€™s healthcare
   Languages/ Fluent in English and French, 1 year of Spanish
   Fieldwork Experience/ Cree and Dene First Nations, Canada, Rajasthan, India, Hanoi, Vietnam, Maputo, Mozambique
