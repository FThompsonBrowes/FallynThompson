  summary: >
    As a global project manager, I have 9+ years experience distilling complex data into clear, 
    accessible findings successfully implemented across multi-disciplinary teams. I enjoy tackling 
    pain points that require scoping projects from conception, collaborating across departments, 
    and ensuring data literacy support.<br />
    <br />
    My expertise is sorting through a mess of raw data to pull out actionable insights and achieve 
    real-time analytics that drive decision-making. My past projects have focused on working with 
    dirty data and building infographics and dashboards for a range of stakeholders from the Government 
    of Canada Department of Foreign Affairs, UNICEF, Fortune 500s, and nonprofits.<br />
    <br />
    Specialties: SQL, Python (timeseries, market basket measures analysis, Plotly), Tableau, Infographics and Dashboards<br />
    Areas of Interest: anomaly detection, behavioural economics, cross-cultural studies, global and women’s healthcare<br />
