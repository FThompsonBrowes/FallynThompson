  The Project Explorer is a data sharing tool detailing and visualizing 1000+ Canadian-invested projects to support responsive programming. Led by CanWaCH (the Canadian Partnership for Women and Children’s Health), the tool allows you to search, understand and deliver progressive programming better for achievement of greater impact. It is creating a cultural shift when it comes to data-sharing, accountability and learning within Canada’s international development community.
